### Project Description - 

### FireHunt (Web Application) is a locally developed Social Media Site that supports Follow & Following Features, Services like Posting & Drafting Messsages, Adding/Removing Self Introduction from Profile and many others. Every Account has a Unique Username & E-Mail ID through which the Profile is identified & processed for operations. The User's Data including Name, Username, E-Mail ID, Self Introduction, Total Posts Count & Other Sections is privately stored in Firebase Firestore Database. Other Information like No. of Followers, Total Following Count, Messages Posted is privately stored in MongoDB Database. The Registering, Logging & Signing Out Services are successfully handled by Firebase Authentication Tools. Upon Successfully Registering, User receives a Verification E-Mail at the E-Mail ID associated with that Account. Without Confirming the E-Mail ID, User is not allowed to navigate to Account Page. The User can Change Self Introduction, Name, Password & can Sign Out & Delete Account from the Account Page. The UserName can Post & Draft Messages from the Home Page of the App. Also, User can navigate to Other User's Profile Page where they can Follow/Unfollow the User in the Profile. The Live Updating & Refreshing of the Data is truly supported on every page of Web App.

### Please Note: All Data (Including Posts, Drafts, Following/Follower Logs) associated with the Account is properly deleted upon Successful Deletion of Account. It is assured that No Data is misued anywhere.
